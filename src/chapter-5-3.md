### 2. Be Timely

Feedback should be timely and immediate. This promotes empathy and emotional intelligence by demonstrating a commitment to addressing issues as they arise and preventing misunderstandings from escalating into conflicts.

### 3. Be Constructive

Feedback should be constructive and focused on improvement rather than criticism. This promotes empathy and emotional intelligence by demonstrating a willingness to support colleagues' growth and development.
